## snipe mint

This simple script is an example of programatically taking part in an NFT minting event/sale. You can configure it with the minting contract and a set of wallets, once the sale time comes around, it'll send a transaction per wallet purchasing NFTs. Make sure to tweak the gas values to something that makes sense for the conditions ;)
